                    <p>A Large Language Model is a massive neural network (typically a Transformer) trained on vast
                        amounts of text data. It can understand, generate, translate, and interact using natural
                        language with human-like proficiency.</p>

                                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Models do not read text like humans; they read
                                    mathematical arrays. Tokenization is the process of breaking raw text down into
                                    numbers (Tokens).</li>
                                <li><strong>Sub-word Tokens:</strong> Modern LLMs use strategies like Byte-Pair Encoding
                                    (BPE). Words are broken down into chunks (e.g., "unhappiness" into "un-", "happi-",
                                    "-ness").</li>

                                    assistant rather than a random text completion generator.</li>

                                        8B)?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: A parameter is a microscopic variable, specifically a
                                        "weight" or "bias" inside the neural network's layers. When we say an LLM has 8
                                        Billion parameters, it means there are 8 Billion individual numbers that were
                                        carefully adjusted during training via calculus to store the model's knowledge

                                        information?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: LLMs do not "know" truths in a database; they are
                                        fundamentally autocomplete engines predicting the next most statistically likely
                                        word based on patterns in their training data. If you ask it for something
                                        obscure, the mathematical patterns guide it to output something that *sounds*

                                        cheaper?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: Normally, fine-tuning an 8B model requires updating all
                                        8 billion parameters, costing thousands of dollars in GPU rent. LoRA freezes all
                                        8 billion base weights and injects tiny "adapter" matrices into the network. You
                                        only train these tiny adapters (maybe 1% of the total parameters). This allows
                                        you to fine-tune a massive model on a single consumer GPU!</span>

                                    <span class="text-muted">A: When an LLM predicts the next word, it generates a list
                                        of probabilities (e.g., Cat: 80%, Dog: 15%, Car: 5%). Temperature scales these
                                        probabilities before the final selection.<br>- <strong>Temp = 0.0:</strong>
                                        Deterministic. Always picks the 80% word.<br>- <strong>Temp = 0.7:</strong>
                                        Balanced. Usually picks top words, but sometimes picks the 15% word for
                                        creativity.<br>- <strong>Temp > 1.0:</strong> High chaos. The probabilities
                                        flatten out, making it start picking random words like "Car".</span>

                                    <strong>Q: What is Mixture of Experts (MoE), like in Mixtral 8x7B?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: A standard dense model uses all of its parameters for
                                        every single word it generates, which is computationally expensive. An MoE model
                                        divides its layers into smaller "Experts" (e.g., an expert in coding, an expert
                                        in French). A router mechanism analyzes the input and only activates the
                                        relevant 2 experts out of 8. This results in a massive model that runs as fast
                                        as a small model!</span>

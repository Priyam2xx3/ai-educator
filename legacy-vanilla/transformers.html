                        Processing by dispensing with recurrence (RNNs/LSTMs) entirely, relying solely on an
                        <strong>Attention Mechanism</strong> to draw global dependencies between input and output.

                                    <strong>Q: Before Transformers, how did AI read text, and why was it
                                        bad?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: AI used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which read
                                        words sequentially, like a human reading left-to-right. If a paragraph was 500
                                        words long, by the time the RNN reached word 500, it had "forgotten" the context
                                        of word 1. It was also incredibly slow to train because you couldn't process
                                        word 50 until you finished word 49.</span>

                                    <strong>Q: Why are Transformers faster to train than RNNs?</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: Transformers do not read sequentially; they read the
                                        *entire sentence simultaneously* in parallel using matrix multiplication. This
                                        means they can take full advantage of modern GPUs, reducing training time from
                                        months to days.</span>

                                    <strong>Q: If Transformers read everything at once, how do they know the order of
                                        words? ("Dog bites man" vs "Man bites dog")</strong><br>
                                    <span class="text-muted">A: This is where <strong>Positional Encoding</strong> comes
                                        in. Since the model has no concept of sequential time, we inject a mathematical
                                        signature (using sine and cosine waves) into every word's embedding before it
                                        enters the model. This acts like a "timestamp" so the model knows "Dog" is at
                                        position 1 and "Man" is at position 3.</span>

                                    <span class="text-muted">A: Imagine you are at a library searching for a specific
                                        book on physics. You have a search query (<strong>Query, Q</strong>). The
                                        library's catalog system has titles for every book (<strong>Keys, K</strong>).
                                        You compare your Query against all the Keys (QK^T) to get a "match score" of how
                                        relevant each book is. You then turn those scores into percentages using
                                        Softmax. Finally, you extract the actual content of the books (<strong>Values,
                                            V</strong>), giving the most attention (multiply by percentage) to the books

                                    <span class="text-muted">A: When multiplying large vectors (Q and K), the resulting
                                        numbers can become massively large. When we pass those massive numbers into the
                                        Softmax function, it outputs a `1` for the largest number and `0` for everything
                                        else, making the gradient flat and killing the learning process. Dividing by
                                        `sqrt(d_k)` scales the numbers down to keep gradients stable.</span>
